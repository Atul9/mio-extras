## History and maintenance

This repository is forked from [`mio-more`](https://github.com/carllerche/mio-more), which is unmaintained.

I don't intend to do very much with this repository apart from keeping it ticking over - bug fixes, updating dependencies, and suchlike.

However if you have some code that you think belongs here, then by all means raise an issue or open a pull request.

## TODO

* Move the tests over from the mio repository
